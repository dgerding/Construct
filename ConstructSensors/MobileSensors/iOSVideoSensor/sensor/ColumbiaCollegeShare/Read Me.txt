What is included in this package:
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Annotated Screen Shots: A folder containing images of what the client and controlelr UI look like when running correctly.  These are just visual samples.

2. Code Drop - (date): 
	-- iOS folder: MonoTouch solution file and all project source code for building the sensor app

	-- Windows folder: Visual Studio solution for building the web service, unit tests and a test UI for controlling running sensors.

3. Application Architecture.docx: Explains the system architecture, algorithms, and components being delivered

4. Build and Deploy Server Components.docx: Describes how to build and run and verify all windows components

5. Build and Deploy iOS Components.docx: Describes how to build the iOS senor app from source code

6. Invoices: previous invoices

7. Remote Sensor Proposal.docx: original proposal


-------------------------------------------------------
What to do:
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Read the Application Architecture doc to get a foundational understanding of what is being delivered

2. Follow the server build/deployment doc steps to verify a working web service that is push-button deployable after code change/recompile cycles.  

3. Run the SensorServiceTests project.  Make sure 11/11 unit tests pass.  This assures that the test server can run on IIS Express on port 8888 for F5 debugging scenarios

4. Follow the sensor build/deploy doc steps

5. Run the app on a sensor and press the play button on the sensor app to put it in command listen mode

6. Publish the web service (if you did not do that already in step 2).  This runs the service inside IIS (NOT IIS Express) and on port 8000 (not 8888).  

7. Run the SensorCommandTestUI from Visual Studio.  The running sensor should show up in the list and be controllable.
