    ///   In probability theory and statistics, the Laplace distribution is a continuous
    ///   probability distribution named after Pierre-Simon Laplace. It is also sometimes called
    ///   the double exponential distribution.</para>
    /// 
    /// <para>
    ///   The difference between two independent identically distributed exponential random
    ///   variables is governed by a Laplace distribution, as is a Brownian motion evaluated at an
    ///   exponentially distributed random time. Increments of Laplace motion or a variance gamma 
    ///   process evaluated over the time scale also have a Laplace distribution.</para>
    /// 
    /// <para>
    ///    The probability density function of the Laplace distribution is also reminiscent of the
    ///    normal distribution; however, whereas the normal distribution is expressed in terms of 
    ///    the squared difference from the mean μ, the Laplace density is expressed in terms of the 
    ///    absolute difference from the mean. Consequently the Laplace distribution has fatter tails
    ///    than the normal distribution.</para>
