/*! @brief Search for faces in an image sequence. 

    This function searches a set of images that are consecutive in time for faces.
    
	The function is able to search on several levels of refinement, see smFaceSearchLevel.
    Each level greatly alters performance. Level-0 is generally fairly fast, but level-1+ are much slower.\n
    - Level-0 runs a fast face detector that can locate a face region and approximate the size and orentiation of that region
    and provides a rough 3D solution.
    - Level-1 runs an algorithm that attempts to locate the interior facial landmarks of each face found by level-0. If the 
      landmarks cannot be located, the face is not "found". Therefore level-1 often finds less faces than level-0, but if a
      face is found, it is found accurately.

    @param image_sequence Must point to an existing array of @a image_sequence_size smImageHandle handles. All images must be the same resoluton. See smImageCreateFromPNG() and smImageCreateFromInfo() 
    @param image_sequence_size Length of the @a image_sequence array. An array containing a single image is valid.
    @param config General configuration settings for the face-search, cannot be 0.
    @param settings Optional detailed configuration settings for the face-search. Can be 0. Specify these values to constrain the search-space of the algorithm and improve performance (recommended).
    @param face_results Must point to an existing smFaceSearchResultList. The contents of this structure are assigned by the routine.
           If no faces were found, the @a num_faces_found field is set to 0 and the @a result array is also set to 0.
    
    @note 
    - If faces were found, when you are done with the list of results, you must call smFaceSearchDestroyResults() to free internal resources.
    - @a face_results will not contain face texture images or face texture coordinate data. I.e. for each smFaceSearchResult, 
        smEngineFaceData::texture == 0, and smFaceLandmark::ftc == {0,0,0}.
