- Analytics Compiler:
Utilizes SMFramework.Testing to apply analytics over a dataset. Stores the result and provides a
convenient HTML/jQuery-based view of those results.

- BatchDataTransform:
Applies the transformations defined within a cluster configuration over an arbitrary number of
raw data recordings.

- CalibrationTool:
Unfinished/unutilized project; meant to provide a means of automatically configuring a signal
through data sampling.

- FaceDataGenerator:
Used for development purposes; generates a CSV recording based on the given parameters.

- MetricsTesting:
Used for development of the "data quality" metric

- RawDataCollection:
Listens for signal data and stores the raw data in a processed CSV format. (Readable by any
application using PlaybackDataStream, data just isn't transformed. Optimal method of capturing
data, since the results aren't influenced by possibly-incorrect cluster configurations. Data
captured can be later transformed via BatchDataTransform.)

- SensorConfigurationViewer:
GUI application for viewing/editing signal cluster configuration files.

- SMFramework:
Common framework containing code that's used in various projects throughout the solution.

- SMVisualization:
Application for visually representing faceLAB data recordings in a 3D environment. Can display
either realtime data or data from a CSV recording.
