/*! @brief Creates an image using externally supplied memory. 

    This function is @a reentrant and @a threadsafe.

    This function allows the creation of an image that can be used with other API routines from
    externally supplied memory. The memory can be copied into a new image, or shared with a new image.
    Memory can be shared only if the start address of scanline is 32-byte aligned.

    @param image_info Contains the required information about the external memory: size, format, step-size, data address etc.
    @param copy_mode This parameter is read as an input argument and written as an output argument.
           It must point to an existing smImageMemoryCopyMode which specifies the desired memory copying behaviour. 
           Normally set to SM_API_IMAGE_MEMORYCOPYMODE_AUTO.
           The function will set the result to either SM_API_IMAGE_MEMORYCOPYMODE_DEEP or SM_API_IMAGE_MEMORYCOPYMODE_SHARED.
           If the image memory is shared, you are responsible for ensuring the memory (or whatever data structure owns it) is not destroyed 
           until the image has been destroyed first. E.g. If the image_info was obtained from another smImageHandle via the function smImageGetInfo(), 
           then you need to ensure that the first smImageHandle is destroyed after the new handle produced by this function.
    @param image_handle Pointer to an existing invalid smImageHandle. A new image is created from the memory and this handle is set to it.
    @return @ref smReturnCode "SM_API_OK" if the function returned successfully.
    @return @ref smReturnCode "SM_API_FAIL_INVALID_ARGUMENT" if any pointer parameter is NULL, image_info is invalid,
        or image_handle != 0.

    for the image memory to be deallocated.

    @param image_handle Must be handle to an existing valid image.
    @return @ref smReturnCode "SM_API_OK" if the function returned successfully.

    @note Each call to smImageAddRef will incur an additional call to smImageDestroy for the memory to be deallocated. 
          This function is primarily useful for implementing shallow copies in OO code.
