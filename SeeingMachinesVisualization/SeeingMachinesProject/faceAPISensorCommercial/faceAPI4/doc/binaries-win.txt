THIS FILE DESCRIBES THE SET OF BINARY FILES THAT FORM
THE FACEAPI BINARY DISTRIBUTION. 

IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ THIS DOCUMENT TO UNDERSTAND 
THE PURPOSE OF EVERY BINARY FILE IN THE DISTRIBUTION. 

------------------------------------------------------------
MINIMUM binary files for deployment:
------------------------------------------------------------
* sm_fa_api4.0.dll

    The main faceAPI shared library. Minor versions increments have 
    filenames sm_fa_api4.1.dll, sm_fa_api4.2.dll etc. 

    Maintenance version increments have the same filename.

    Look at the file properties to see full version 
    information.
    Production license variants of this shared library are made 
    specifically for customers who have signed a production 
    license agreement with Seeing Machines.

* sm_ca_resource_facesearchv2_level0_cdefault_7.1.dll
* sm_ca_resource_facesearchv2_level1_cdefault_7.1.dll

    These are resource shared libraries that contain coefficients 
    for detecting faces. 
    
    Be aware that the version number of these shared libraries may
    change with subsequent releases of faceAPI.

    The "cdefault" resources are for operating with images
    exposed to visible lighting conditions, such as webcams.

    These shared libraries are delay loaded and optional. 
    The HeadTrackingEngine requires a set of "level0" 
    and "level1" coefficients, without which it will not
    be able to track any faces.

    The FaceSearcherEngine and smFaceSearch() function
    need at least a "level0" coefficient, corresponding
    to a level-0 type face-search. For a level-1 face-search
    both "level0" and "level1" coefficients are required.
    
* libiomp5md.dll

    OpenMP. faceAPI uses Intel OpenMP technology. OpenMP
    cannot be statically linked against as this would 
    prevent faceAPI customers from using OpenMP in their
    own code. Hence, this shared library must be installed alongside
    sm_fa_api4.0.dll.

* Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest
* msvcm90.dll
* msvcp90.dll
* msvcr90.dll

    Microsoft Visual C++ 9 runtime libraries.
    The manifest file is needed and is searched for from
    sm_fa_api4.0.dll. The microsoft runtime redistributable does not 
    need to be installed on the target machine, as 
    sm_fa_api4.0.dll is islolated. sm_fa_api4.0.dll refers to these 
    files which must be in the same folder.



------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL binary files:
------------------------------------------------------------

* cam_blacklist.txt

    Text configuration file containing names of camera devices
    that should always be ignored. These are usually cameras 
    that have non-conforming or unusual drivers which do not
    operate with faceAPI.
    Recommended for applications that need to operate with
    random WDM (webcam) cameras.

* cam_whitelist.txt

    Text configuration file containing names of camera devices
    that skip the camera "test phase" on startup. This test phase
    simply tries to initialize the camera - this initialization 
    detected if another process is using the camera, or the 
    camera driver is improperly installed, and if so, the camera
    is not available to faceAPI. Sometimes this test-phase can
    cause problems with cameras that have partially functional
    drivers.
    Recommended for applications that need to operate with
    random WDM (webcam) cameras.

* FlyCapture2_v90.dll
* FlyCapture2GUI_v90.dll
* FlyCapture2Managed_v90.dll
* FlyCap2CameraControl_v90.dll

    Development License only.

    Shared libraries for controlling the PointGrey camera.
    These are delay loaded and if missing you won't be able 
    to use PointGrey cameras through their advanced driver.

    PointGrey cameras may still be visible via any installed
    WDM driver, but the WDM driver only offers limited 
    control capabilites and is ignored by default in 
    cam_blacklist.txt.

    NOTE: The PointGrey libraries have an embedded manifest which
    requires a suitable version of the Microsoft.VC90.CRT assembly
    to be available on the system. If a dialog is displayed indicating a
    manifest problem when loading the faceAPI binaries, try installing
    the latest "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)"
    from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2019667.

* sm_ca_resource_facesearchv2_level0_ir_7.1.dll
* sm_ca_resource_facesearchv2_level1_ir_7.1.dll

    Development License only.

    These are resource shared libraries that contain coefficients 
    for detecting faces under *infrared* conditions,
    specifically where the camera is BELOW the
    face, and should typically be used in conjunction
    with the faceAPI IR Lighting kit.

    The version number suffix of these shared libraries may
    change with subsequent releases of faceAPI.

* cal subfolder.

    This contains precalibrated .lens files for common
    webcam models. The list is by no means complete.
    If you are building an application that requires 
    compatibility with a large range of devices, it is
    recommended that you increase this list of .lens files
    for as many models of webcams as possible, and include
    the subfolder in the same folder as sm_fa_api4.0.dll.
    If faceAPI does not find a suitable matching .lens file
    it must guess the field-of-view of the camera and will
    not be able to compensate for any lens distortion,
    resulting in degraded performance.

------------------------------------------------------------
HeadTrackingDemo
------------------------------------------------------------

* headtrackingdemo.exe

    This demo is built using faceAPI and some internal library
    code. It depends the other shared libraries in the api\bin folder except 
    sm_fa_api4.0.dll (HeadTrackingDemo is statically linked).

------------------------------------------------------------
FileTracker
------------------------------------------------------------

* smtrackfile.exe

    Development License only.

    This tool is built using faceAPI and some internal library
    code. It depends on all the libraries in the api\bin folder.
  
------------------------------------------------------------
Thirdparty Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------

The faceAPI shared library is isolated. It does not depend on any 
additional shared libraries to be installed on a clean Windows XP SP3, 
Vista or Win7 system.

The development license of faceAPI requires the HASP runtime
to be installed. This is the dongle driver.
